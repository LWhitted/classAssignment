//include a couple of sentences about what topics we've covered so far you feel like has been most challenging, then commit and push that file as well.
So far in class we've learned a vast amount of topics. These topics include: understanding our terminal shell, how to use VS Code, javaScript, git, github, how to creat directories and files on our local computers, what repos are and how to push it to our github accounts, functions, objects, arrays, conditions and loops. 
The most challanging thing for me so far is that I am new to coding and some topics I just don't have background on so it takes me  a little while to grasp what certain things do (for example Netlify was confusing. I had to research further to understand what was happening). I am pretty good at researching though so even though I often get stuck, I am able to come upon the answer by being resourceful. Whether that be using google, youtube, class resources on our blackboard site, office hours, or reaching out to classmates for help.
